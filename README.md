# Password Malware

It is a very simple but effective python malware to steel password from a windows machine and send the result to your email. For now you need to make sure that you have
install python on the target machine. 


With further advancements I will make this more advanced and build a packge so that you can hide this malware into an image or a pdf or just create an exe file so 
that it would be easier to run on the target windows machine machine.


Also, this malware can be used for linux machines, mac os also.

## Software and Libraries used to build the code 

I used a pre-built malware called laZagne to steel the passwords from the windows machine.
